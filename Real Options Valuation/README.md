# Real Option Valuation (ROV)

Using Real Option Valuation (ROV) in to investment decisions in petroleum exploration and production projects. 



Real Options Analysis extends financial option theory to real assets, allowing valuation of flexibility embedded in exploration and development.

> Real options transform uncertainty from risk into opportunity.
> ROV captures the value of waiting and adapting decisions under uncertainty.



**Oilfield development projects are exposed to**:

* Oil price volatility
* Reserve uncertainty
* Regulatory risk
* Capital cost fluctuations
* Technological uncertainty

**Using Real Options in Oil & Gas Projects benefits**: 

* Capturing Managerial Flexibility
* Handling High Volatility
* Accounting for Investment Irreversibility
* Valuing Information and Learning (Sequential Decisions)
* Optimizing Timing
* Strategic Positioning (Growth Options)
* Risk Management




Upstream petroleum projects stages :
* Exploration
* Appraisal
* Field Development
* Production
* Abandonment
