#### Risk Analysis using Monte Carlo Simulation

Monte Carlo Simulation is a quantitative technique that utilizes random sampling and probability theory to assess uncertainties and model risks in complex systems. It is particularly beneficial when dealing with multiple variables that have inherent uncertainties, such as financial forecasts, engineering projects, or market dynamics.
