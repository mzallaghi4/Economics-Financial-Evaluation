## Economic Evaluation and Financial Modelling for Decision-making
The Economic Evaluation and Financial Modelling for Decision-making project aims to apply advanced economic evaluation techniques and financial modelling methods to support decision-making.

This project explores how quantitative models and economic evaluations can be used to assess investment opportunities, evaluate risk, forecast economic trends, and make informed financial decisions.

The project uses techniques such as:
- Net Present Value (NPV)
- Internal Rate of Return (IRR)
- Monte Carlo simulations
- Risk Analysis

in order to model, evaluate, and make decisions regarding investment projects, business strategies, and financial portfolios.


#### Time Value of Money (TVM)


TVM Calculations
- Future Value (lump sum & annuity)
- Present Value (lump sum & annuity)
- Payment calculations
- Interest rate and period calculations

You can find the TVM calculations in the [TVM Notebook](https://github.com/mzallaghi4/Economics-Financial-Evaluation/blob/main/TVM.ipynb).
